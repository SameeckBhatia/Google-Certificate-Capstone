# Salifort EDP: Employee Departure Predictor

of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked you with
analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention.
To help with this, they would like you to design a model that predicts whether
an employee will leave the company based on their department, number of
projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful."
